# Overview

This is a repository for my learnngs and projects for the MATH524 Linear Algebra class at SDSU in Fall Semester 2024.

The textbook and data is by our professor [Samuel Shen](https://shen.sdsu.edu).

Because there is a lot of data for this class, I did not include it in version control. To make the project work, download & unzip the data folder from [here](https://climatemathematics.sdsu.edu/Datasets.html) and move it to the repository folder.

### Formatting Info

If you use VSCode, add the R Extension. There is a .vscode file at the root of this repo with soem VSCode settings to keep things clean.
Format on save is activated:

```json
{
  "[r]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "REditorSupport.r"
  },
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```
